        <p>
            Our mix engineers have been recording, mixing, and mastering music as far back as the late 80's (during the last major shift from analogue to digital). <br /> Even today, many of the secrets and skills that were developed back then to attain maximum fidelity and warmth in a final mix still apply and are implemented in our mixing and mastering studio's.<br />Our engineers utilize these fundamental principles  while taking full advantage of the modern audio technologies that continue to advance and evolve.<br />
            Using state of the art equipment and software, our sound mixers are well trained to deliver the “right” sound for the track at hand, and their professionalism and expertise allows them to deliver fast and at a highly competitive price.

        <p class="informative">When multi track recording in the digital domain (computer software or digital recorders) each individual recording track may have multiple audio segments placed throughout the length of the song with periods of nothing in between.</p><br /> <p>The software used to record the tracks will keep track of the segment placing. If these audio files are used inside a different software recording/playback tool they will most likely not be placed in their correct locations in relation to where they were recorded.</p><br />
        <p>This requires them to be placed manually which can be quite time consuming and prone to errors and timing issues.</p>
        <p>
            To avoid this problem when moving multitrack recordings between platforms, it is common to re-render the full length of each individual track (and its multiple audio clips) into one continuous file.
        </p><br /> <p>
            This process has different names like “Consolidate”, “Bounce”, and “render” depending on the program being used.

            Meter Masters fully understands that different music genres require different tonal characteristics. From the “flat” frequency spectrum of Rock and Alternative, the warming of the mid-low frequencies in pop/dance music, or the slightly bass dominant hip hop and electronic music tracks.<br />
            All mixes will be mastered appropriately to fully comply with industry standards and the expectations of club and radio DJ’s.
            Therefore, a little bit of pre-mixing insight from you combined with our many years mixing expertise ensures you get the perfect mix as it relates to its target audience, YOUR AUDIENCE!<br />
            When submitting your tracks to us, be sure to answer the associated questions to make sure that we get your mix done the way you require the first time.<br />
            Up to 3 different mixes with variations (i.e. vocal levels, bass variations, instrumental, acapella, etc.) can be included for no extra charge. More alternate mixes/versions (beyond the 3 included) can be added for only $5 extra per version.

            Soon after you submit the link to your archived tracks/session to be mixed, we will evaluate your files, mix specifications, and requirements, to verify that everything is in order for us to proceed.

        <p>Within 48 hours from then you will receive a link where you can listen to the final mix/es and either:</p><br />
        <ul>
            <li>

            <li>
                Decide that the mix isn’t for you and decline the mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Purchase the final mix/es immediately.

        <br /><hr /><p>
                        If for any reason we cannot work with the files you send we will promptly respond with the reason and suggestions to immediately correct the situation so that we may begin as soon as possible.
